# üîí Cascade Deletion System - Data Integrity Guide

## üìã **Overview**

The PIM System now implements comprehensive cascade deletion to maintain data integrity and prevent orphaned records. When a tenant or user is deleted, all related data is automatically removed, ensuring a clean and consistent database state.

---

## üéØ **Key Benefits**

### **Data Integrity**
- **No Orphaned Records**: Prevents data inconsistencies
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Related data is removed automatically
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintains proper relationships between tables

### **Administrative Efficiency**
- **Single Delete Operation**: Delete a tenant and all related data is removed
- **No Manual Cleanup**: Eliminates the need for manual data cleanup
- **Reduced Errors**: Prevents accidental data inconsistencies

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Complete Data Removal**: Ensures sensitive data is fully deleted
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains proper audit logs for compliance
- **User Privacy**: Completely removes user data when accounts are deleted

---

## üîÑ **Cascade Deletion Flow**

### **1. Tenant Deletion Cascade**
When a tenant is deleted, the following data is automatically removed:

```
Tenant (deleted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Users (all users in the tenant)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Categories (all product categories)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Products (all products in the tenant)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Product Additional Data (product-specific fields)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Field Mappings (CSV field mappings)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Field Configurations (searchable/editable field settings)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tenant Progress (onboarding progress tracking)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Chat Sessions (AI chat conversations)
```

### **2. User Deletion Cascade**
When a user is deleted, the following data is automatically removed:

```
User (deleted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Audit Logs (all user actions and activities)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chat Sessions (AI chat conversations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Created Users (users created by this user)
```

### **3. Product Deletion Cascade**
When a product is deleted, the following data is automatically removed:

```
Product (deleted)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Product Additional Data (custom fields and values)
```

### **4. Category Deletion Cascade**
When a category is deleted, the following data is automatically removed:

```
Category (deleted)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Products (all products in this category)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Product Additional Data (product-specific fields)
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Database Schema Changes**

### **Foreign Key Constraints**
All foreign key relationships now include `ON DELETE CASCADE`:

```sql
-- User -> Tenant relationship
tenant_id INTEGER REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Product -> Tenant relationship  
tenant_id INTEGER REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Category -> Tenant relationship
tenant_id INTEGER REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Product -> Category relationship
category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

-- User -> User relationship (created_by)
created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

### **Relationship Definitions**
SQLAlchemy relationships include cascade options:

```python
# Tenant model
users = relationship("User", back_populates="tenant", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
products = relationship("Product", back_populates="tenant", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
categories = relationship("Category", back_populates="tenant", cascade="all, delete-orphan")

# User model
audit_logs = relationship("AuditLog", back_populates="user", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
chat_sessions = relationship("ChatSession", back_populates="user", cascade="all, delete-orphan")

# Product model
additional_data = relationship("ProductAdditionalData", back_populates="product", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
```

---

## üöÄ **Implementation Details**

### **SQLite Foreign Key Support**
The system automatically enables foreign key support for SQLite:

```python
# Enable foreign key support for SQLite
if "sqlite" in str(engine.url):
    from sqlalchemy import event
    @event.listens_for(engine, "connect")
    def set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
        cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON")
        cursor.close()
```

### **Database Initialization**
Foreign keys are enabled during database creation:

```python
# Enable foreign key support for SQLite
if "sqlite" in str(engine.url):
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        conn.execute(text("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON"))
        logger.info("‚úÖ Foreign key support enabled")
```

## üìä **Data Lifecycle Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Company Closure**
```
1. Admin deletes tenant "ABC Company"
2. System automatically removes:
   - All 50 users in the company
   - All 200 product categories
   - All 5,000 products
   - All field configurations
   - All progress tracking data
   - All chat session history
3. Database remains clean with no orphaned records
```

### **Scenario 2: User Account Deletion**
```
1. Admin deletes user "john.doe@company.com"
2. System automatically removes:
   - All audit logs for this user
   - All chat sessions initiated by this user
   - All users created by this user (if any)
3. User data is completely removed from the system
```

### **Scenario 3: Product Category Removal**
```
1. Admin deletes category "Electronics"
2. System automatically removes:
   - All 150 products in the Electronics category
   - All additional data for those products
3. Category and related products are completely removed
```

## üîß **Administrative Operations**

### **Safe Deletion Practices**
- **Always verify** what will be deleted before proceeding
- **Use soft deletion** for data that might need recovery
- **Backup important data** before major deletions
- **Test cascade behavior** in development environment

### **Recovery Options**
- **Database backups** for complete data recovery
- **Audit logs** for tracking what was deleted
- **Soft deletion** option for critical data (future enhancement)

---

## üß™ **Testing the System**

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check foreign key support
sqlite3 data/pim.db "PRAGMA foreign_keys;"

# Verify cascade relationships
sqlite3 data/pim.db ".schema"

# Test cascade deletion (use the test script)
python3 test_cascade_deletion.py
```

### **Manual Testing**
1. **Create test data** in a development environment
2. **Delete a tenant** and verify all related data is removed
3. **Delete a user** and verify audit logs and chat sessions are removed
4. **Check database state** to ensure no orphaned records exist

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

### **Irreversible Operations**
- **Cascade deletion is permanent** - deleted data cannot be recovered
- **No confirmation prompts** - deletion happens immediately
- **Affects all related data** - be certain before deleting

### **Performance Impact**
- **Large deletions** may take time for complex relationships
- **Transaction size** increases with cascade operations
- **Database locks** may occur during large deletions

### **Backup Requirements**
- **Regular backups** are essential before major operations
- **Point-in-time recovery** may be needed for large deletions
- **Test restores** to ensure backup integrity

---

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

### **Soft Deletion**
- **Mark records as deleted** instead of physical removal
- **Recovery options** for accidentally deleted data
- **Audit trail** for all deletion operations

### **Batch Operations**
- **Bulk deletion** with progress tracking
- **Scheduled deletions** for maintenance operations
- **Deletion queues** for large operations

### **Advanced Recovery**
- **Recycle bin** for recently deleted items
- **Selective restoration** of deleted data
- **Conflict resolution** for complex relationships

## üÜò **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Foreign keys disabled**: Ensure `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`
2. **Cascade not working**: Check database schema and constraints
3. **Performance issues**: Monitor transaction size and locks
4. **Data inconsistencies**: Verify all relationships are properly defined

### **Getting Help**
- **Check logs** for detailed error information
- **Verify schema** with `.schema` command
- **Test relationships** with sample data
- **Review constraints** for proper cascade setup
